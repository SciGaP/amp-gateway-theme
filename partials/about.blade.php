      AMPGateway is an online portal that hosts a suite of codes being developed by the atomic and molecular physics 
      community to study a variety of problems involving the time-independent and time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation. 
      They include the calculation of cross sections for electron scattering and photoionization from atoms and molecules
      and the interaction of strong, time-dependent electromagnetic fields with these systems.  Eventually we hope to 
      include codes to calculate cross sections for the vibration and rotational excitation of heavy particle systems as 
      well as reactive collision.  Many of these processes are of importance in astrophysics, fusion research, 
      lighting, and the etching of silicon for computer chip production.

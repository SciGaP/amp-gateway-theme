    The Laboratory for Single Cell Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania is home to a multidisciplinary team including statisticians, bioinformaticians and students from a wide range of disciplines such as applied math, medicine and computational biology. We conduct state-of the art research, specifically focussing on methods development for genomic data, analysis of high-throughput experiments, and designing computational models for transcriptomics studies. Recently, our team has diverted its attention to the exciting field of single-cell genomics, wherein we are developing new analytical tools as well as leading hypothesis-driven projects for new biological discoveries.

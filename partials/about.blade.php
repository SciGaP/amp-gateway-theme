    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:20px;" align="left">
     The gateway was a result of a workshop at the Institute for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular
     Physics (ITAMP) held at the Harvard-Smithsonian in May of 2018.   The focus of the workshop
     was to examine the requirements and to then suggest a process for developing robust and
     flexible software in AMP.  A subset of the attendees felt the time was ripe to bring together
     the AMP community to work collectively to make their codes available and easier to use by the
     partners and eventually the AMP community at large. By necessity, a project such as this
     requires the developers to work on issues of
     portability, documentation, ease of input,as well as making sure the codes can run on a
     variety of architectures.  Doing this via the Science Gateways arm of the NSF XSEDE project
     seemed a natural avenue.  We applied to the program for a startup award, which was granted,
     and began our efforts in earnest in July of 2018

<p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:20px;" align="left">
      AMPGateway is an online portal that hosts a suite of codes being developed by the atomic and molecular physics 
      community to study a variety of problems involving the time-independent and time-dependent Schrödinger equation. 
      They include the calculation of cross sections for electron scattering and photoionization from atoms and molecules
      and the interaction of strong, time-dependent electromagnetic fields with these systems.  Eventually we hope to 
      include codes to calculate cross sections for the vibration and rotational excitation of heavy particle systems as 
      well as reactive collision.  Many of these processes are of importance in astrophysics, fusion research, 
      lighting, and the etching of silicon for computer chip production.

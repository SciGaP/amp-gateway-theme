      AMPGateway is an online portal that hosts a suite of codes being developed by the atomic and molecular physics community to study a variety of problems involving the time-independent and time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation. These involve electron, heavy particle and reactive scattering and interaction with external fields.  Processes treated include collision cross sections for electron-atom and electron-molecule scattering, photoionization and excitation and ionization of atoms and molecules by short-pulse, intense radiation.  Many of these processes are of importance in astrophysics, fusion research, lighting, and the etching of silicon for computer chip production.
